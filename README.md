# BECSimulations

This repository contains some of the code I used for making figures in my master's thesis.
All the code makes use of the excellent GPELab package http://gpelab.math.cnrs.fr/
The correct citations can be found in my thesis
Downloading GPELab is required to run the code
Note that in some cases you need the addpath(genpath('[folder containing GPELab]')) command in Matlab to recognise GPELab functions
Feel free to contact me with questions about this!
